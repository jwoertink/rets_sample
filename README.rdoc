= Rets on Rails Sample App
This is a sample rails app using the ruby-rets gem. This will be a way to test out building a rets-rails gem.

== Install
just clone it, and add in a `config/rets_config.yml` file. You can copy the sample in that folder as an example.


== Future
Here's some example of what I'd like to see

RETS::Property.all

RETS::Property.scope('EA,ER,C').limit(10)

RETS::Property.search(:list_price => 100000..200000, :bedrooms => 4)

RETS::Office.all
